--SOUNDSTROLL--

SOUNDSTROLL is a "three-dimensional sequencer"
Each solid sphere represents the position of a sound source in a space,
each gridshape sphere is a 'trigger' linked to a sound source - solid sphere of same color,
the crossing of a trigger by the user will start the linked source.

The sources are spatialised in space, around the user,
akin real sound sources in a real environment in which one moves.


--START--


First open
shapes, sfcolorsgui then a patch which names includes "soundhost",
depending on desired spatialisation engine.

Saving a scene : 
use button commented "save" in shapes OR
the button commented "save" in sfcolorsgui.
In both cases, it is needed to select or create a folder, which will contain
the scene thus recorded.

Recalling a scene : 
use button commented "read" in shapes OR
the button commented "save" in sfcolorsgui.
Select a folder containing desired scene.

( If a scene is not well recalled/is making difficulties at startup :
	-rescale, in linked mode, rebellious triger spheres
	-change mode (linked/not linked) once each.
	-slightly move a sphere.
	-"Re-import from main" sounds of sfcolorsgui which are not correcly recalled.
If nothing works, a Max reboot can help...)
